Steps to Set Up E-Commerce Backend Services:

1. Pull Required Docker Images

Open your terminal and run the following commands to pull the necessary Docker images for the e-commerce backend services:

	docker pull gautam01/e-commerce-backend:service-discovery
	docker pull gautam01/e-commerce-backend:api-gateway
	docker pull gautam01/e-commerce-backend:user-service
	docker pull gautam01/e-commerce-backend:product-service
	docker pull gautam01/e-commerce-backend:order-service
	docker pull gautam01/e-commerce-backend:payment-service
	docker pull gautam01/e-commerce-backend:notification-service
	
	Note: Ensure that Docker is running on your machine before executing these commands.

2. Navigate to the Directory Containing docker-compose.yml

Once the images are pulled, navigate to the directory where your docker-compose.yml file is located. You can do this by running:


3. Start the Services with Docker Compose

In the same directory as docker-compose.yml, execute the following command to start the services:

	docker-compose up

This command will build and start the containers defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

4. Run in Detached Mode (Optional)

If you prefer to run the services in the background (detached mode), use the following command instead:

	docker-compose up -d

This will start the services in the background, allowing you to use your terminal for other tasks.

Additional Notes:

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and up-to-date on your machine.

To stop the services later, run:

docker-compose down

This stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes defined in your docker-compose.yml.
